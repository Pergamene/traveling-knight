# The Traveling Knight

React | TypeScript

## Objective

The **Knight** must visit every square on the board without returning to a previously visited square.

## Reasoning

I've used this game at a programming summer camp I instruct.  I had just finished learning React and wanted to see if I could make a game*.  I also took the opportunity to explore using TypeScript instead of JavaScript in my React apps.  

```
*I was not concerned with usability so the app is not responsive and does not display correctly on small screens.
```
