# The Traveling Knight

[Playable link](https://pergamene.github.io/traveling-knight)

## Instructions

To start the game click anywhere on the board to place your **Knight**.  This will highlight all of the cells that the **Knight** could travel too.  

The object of the game is to help the **Knight** visit every square on the board, *but* when the **Knight** leave a square it gets an **X** preventing the **Knight** from visiting that square again. 

Can your **Knight** visit all 64 squares?

## Motivation

For years I've taught programming at a University summer camp, and this game is one of the projects I've taught the kids how to make.  So when I got comfortable using React to make web apps, I wanted to see if I could use it to make a game, and this was the camp project that I decided to attempt.  This game is so fun to teach the kids, and even more fun to see them play it, especially since so many of them are able to solve it!  

This game was a fun way to practice my new React skills, and gave me a side project I could use to explore using TypeScript instead of JavaScript.

```
*I was not concerned with usability so the app is not responsive and does not display correctly on small screens.
